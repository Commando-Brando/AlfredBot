# What is it?
  > A discord bot, for professors and students alike.

## Inspiration
We wanted to do something that would help both professors and students alike. 

## What it does
Alfred stores upcoming course assignment due dates. An instructor can add or remove assignments. Instructors and students can see the next assignment due. Students can even have their own individual event calendars.

## How we built it
We built the discord bot using Python. It took a lot of work, time and energy. 
We used json files to store the event information. 

## Challenges we ran into
None of us had ever created a bot before. So we had to learn how to access information and utilize the bot. Working with json was a challenge too, storing and accessing the information. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We succeeded! Our bot works! Alfred can store due dates and assignments. Delete them and present the next one coming up for a class.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about discord bots! What they can do! They really do seem somewhat magical but in the end it is all technology!

## What's next for Alfred
We want to do more with Alfred. We want automated reminders about upcoming due dates. We want to add a timer, such that the timer can be set for the duration of an exam. Or for students to remind them to study after some time. We would also like to port the Json files to a database.
